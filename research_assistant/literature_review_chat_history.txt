Adversaries are motivated to mount such attacks for a variety of reasons, ranging from reducing their computational costs, to eliminating the need to collect expensive training data, to obtaining a copy of a model in order to find adversarial examples, perform membership inference, or model inversion attacks. In this paper, we taxonomize the space of model extraction attacks around two objectives: accuracy, i.e., performing well on the underlying learning task, and fidelity, i.e., matching the predictions of the remote victim classifier on any input. To extract a high-accuracy model, we develop a learning-based attack which exploits the victim to supervise the training of an extracted model. Through analytical and empirical arguments, we then explain the inherent limitations that prevent any learningbased strategy from extracting a truly high-fidelity model\u2014i.e., extracting a functionally-equivalent model whose predictions are identical to those of the victim model on all possible inputs. Addressing these limitations, we expand on prior work to develop the first practical functionally-equivalent extraction attack for direct extraction (i.e., without training) of a model\u2019s weights. We perform experiments both on academic datasets and a state-of-the-art image classifier trained with 1 billion proprietary images. In addition to broadening the scope of model extraction research, our work demonstrates the practicality of model extraction attacks against production-grade systems.\n\n\nPublished year: 2022\nTitle: Truth Serum: Poisoning Machine Learning Models to Reveal Their Secrets\nAuthors: Florian Tram\u00e8r, R.

'Truth Serum: Poisoning Machine Learning Models to Reveal Their Secrets' (2022): This paper introduces a new class of attacks on machine learning models. The authors show that an adversary who can poison a training dataset can cause models trained on this dataset to leak significant private details of training points belonging to other parties. Their attacks are effective across membership inference, attribute inference, and data extraction.\",\n            \"append\": true\n        }\n    }\n}", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "ai", "example": false}}, {"type": "system", "data": {"content": "Command write_file returned: File written successfully to Carlini_Papers_Summaries.txt.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "system"}}, {"type": "human", "data": {"content": "Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "human", "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "{\n    \"thoughts\": {\n        \"text\": \"I have written summaries of three papers that expand on Carlini's work to a file.
