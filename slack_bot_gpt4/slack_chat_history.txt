Goodfellow, H. B. McMahan, Ilya Mironov, Kunal Talwar, Li Zhang\nAstract: Machine learning techniques based on neural networks are achieving remarkable results in a wide variety of domains. Often, the training of models requires large, representative datasets, which may be crowdsourced and contain sensitive information. The models should not expose private information in these datasets. Addressing this goal, we develop new algorithmic techniques for learning and a refined analysis of privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that we can train deep neural networks with non-convex objectives, under a modest privacy budget, and at a manageable cost in software complexity, training efficiency, and model quality.\n\n\nPublished year: 2014\nTitle: The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy\nAuthors: C. Dwork, Aaron Roth\nAstract: The problem of privacy-preserving data analysis has a long history spanning multiple disciplines. As electronic data about individuals becomes increasingly detailed, and as technology enables ever more powerful collection and curation of these data, the need increases for a robust, meaningful, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy, together with a computationally rich class of algorithms that satisfy this definition. Differential Privacy is such a definition.After motivating and discussing the meaning of differential privacy, the preponderance of this monograph is devoted to fundamental techniques for achieving differential privacy, and application of these techniques in creative combinations, using the query-release problem as an ongoing example. A key point is that, by rethinking the computational goal, one can often obtain far better results than would be achieved by methodically replacing each step of a non-private computation with a differentially private implementation. Despite some astonishingly powerful computational results, there are still fundamental limitations \u2014 not just on what can be achieved with differential privacy but on what can be achieved with any method that protects against a complete breakdown in privacy. Virtually all the algorithms discussed herein maintain differential privacy against adversaries of arbitrary computational power. Certain algorithms are computationally intensive, others are efficient. Computational complexity for the adversary and the algorithm are both discussed.We then turn from fundamentals to applications other than queryrelease, discussing differentially private methods for mechanism design and machine learning. The vast majority of the literature on differentially private algorithms considers a single, static, database that is subject to many analyses. Differential privacy in other models, including distributed databases and computations on data streams is discussed.Finally, we note that this work is meant as a thorough introduction to the problems and techniques of differential privacy, but is not intended to be an exhaustive survey \u2014 there is by now a vast amount of work in differential privacy, and we can cover only a small portion of it.\n\n\nPublished year: 2006\nTitle: Differential Privacy\nAuthors: C.

A possible protection is offered by anonymization of the\ntraining data or training function with differential privacy. However, data\nscientists can choose between local and central differential privacy and need\nto select meaningful privacy parameters $\\epsilon$ which is challenging for\nnon-privacy experts. We empirically compare local and central differential\nprivacy mechanisms under white- and black-box membership inference to evaluate\ntheir relative privacy-accuracy trade-offs. We experiment with several datasets\nand show that this trade-off is similar for both types of mechanisms. This\nsuggests that local differential privacy is a sound alternative to central\ndifferential privacy for differentially private deep learning, since small\n$\\epsilon$ in central differential privacy and large $\\epsilon$ in local\ndifferential privacy result in similar membership inference attack risk.\n\nPublished: 2021-12-25\nTitle: Gradient Leakage Attack Resilient Deep Learning\nAuthors: Wenqi Wei, Ling Liu\nSummary: Gradient leakage attacks are considered one of the wickedest privacy threats\nin deep learning as attackers covertly spy gradient updates during iterative\ntraining without compromising model training quality, and yet secretly\nreconstruct sensitive training data using leaked gradients with high attack\nsuccess rate. Although deep learning with differential privacy is a defacto\nstandard for publishing deep learning models with differential privacy\nguarantee, we show that differentially private algorithms with fixed privacy\nparameters are vulnerable against gradient leakage attacks. This paper\ninvestigates alternative approaches to gradient leakage resilient deep learning\nwith differential privacy (DP). First, we analyze existing implementation of\ndeep learning with differential privacy, which use fixed noise variance to\ninjects constant noise to the gradients in all layers using fixed privacy\nparameters. Despite the DP guarantee provided, the method suffers from low\naccuracy and is vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks. Second, we present a\ngradient leakage resilient deep learning approach with differential privacy\nguarantee by using dynamic privacy parameters. Unlike fixed-parameter\nstrategies that result in constant noise variance, different dynamic parameter\nstrategies present alternative techniques to introduce adaptive noise variance\nand adaptive noise injection which are closely aligned to the trend of gradient\nupdates during differentially private model training. Finally, we describe four\ncomplementary metrics to evaluate and compare alternative approaches.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-30\nTitle: Vision Through the Veil: Differential Privacy in Federated Learning for Medical Image Classification\nAuthors: Kishore Babu Nampalle, Pradeep Singh, Uppala Vivek Narayan, Balasubramanian Raman\nSummary: The proliferation of deep learning applications in healthcare calls for data\naggregation across various institutions, a practice often associated with\nsignificant privacy concerns.
